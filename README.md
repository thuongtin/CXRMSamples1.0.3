# Interface Documentation Design Document

This repository contains the design and API documentation structure for the Rokid CXRM Samples Android application.  
For the full specification, refer to `design.md`, which describes:
- Overall document structure and sections  
- Bluetooth, audio, video, photo, device information, custom view, custom protocol, and media file management APIs  
- Data models, enums, callbacks, constants, and error handling strategies  

All original Chinese content has been translated to English to make it easier for international developers to use and extend the samples.
